<h3>A funny story</h3><br>
<p style="width: 500px;">My boyfriend and I went skinny dipping in the sea at night, at one point he couldn't find his phone, we called it with mine but couldn't hear a thing. 
    We started pannicking because it was dark and this would've been the third phone in a year that was gone. He can't see anything in the dark so I put on 
    his t-shirt and start looking with my flashlight. I walked down the street in thhe middle of the night to search if he hadn't lost it there.
    Meanwhile the police drive by asking me if everything is okay, and I have to explain to them, in just a t-shirt that I'm looking for my boyfriends phone. 
    They leave me to search and after a 20 minute search my boyfriend calls me to tell me he found his phone in his shoes.</p><br>
    <h4>Moral of the story, don't panic!</h4>
